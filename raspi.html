            <p>
            I decided to use my Raspberry Pi as part of a project for creating my own wireless access point.
            As a college student, I do not get the best WiFi reception in my dorm room. So I bought a wireless
            dongle and programmed it to create my own network that connects me to the University network.
            My network speed ended up being 10x faster with my new device because of its close proximity to
            my devices.
            <br><br>
            A problem occurred when I tried to form a SSH connection to the RasPi, because the IP address kept
            changing, and the University blocked any way of forming a static IP address. To solve this dilemma
            I created a script on the Pi that checks the previous IP address in a .txt file and compared it to the
            currrent IP address. If the addresses were different (meaning that it had changed), it texts me on my phone
            to alert me of the new IP. I used Cron to have the script run every 15 minutes, so I am always up to date
            if I want to connect wirelessly to my Raspberry Pi.
