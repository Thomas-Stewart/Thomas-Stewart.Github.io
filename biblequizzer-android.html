              This is a continuation of my idea for building a Bible quizzer using Java.
              Previously, I had made an application that parsed verses from a particular website
              just to learn how it worked. Now, the same game is on Android devices,
              but it uses a Bible API to fetch the verses.
              <br><br>
              I plan to implement more features including the ability to focus
              on just one particular book of the Bible, where the user must
              choose which chapter the verse belongs in. And I also want to focus on
              chapters so the user must choose which verse it belongs in.
              </p>

              <a href ="Images/bquiz1.jpg"><img src="Images/bquiz1.jpg" alt="android program quiz 2" style="width:50%; height:50%"></a>
              I hope to continue developing this to the point where I can place it
              on the app store and people can use it to further their Scripture memory.
              <br>
              This is a great project for me because I get to learn and try playing with
              Java, Android, parsing, APIs, and threads.
