          <h3>Prepared For The Calling</h3>
          <li>
            2/1/15
            <div class ="li-class">
              <p>"While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter)
                and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them,
                'Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.' Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
                And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother,
                in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left
                the boat and their father and followed him."<br>- Matthew 4:18-22
                <br><br>
                I am extremely encouraged at the actions of the first disciples. They made the decision
                to leave everything in pursuit of this Jesus character. I don't know how much fame Jesus
                had acquired at this time, but it couldn't have been hardly any. It wasn't like these four
                fishermen were loitering around with nothing to do. They had lives. They had occupations.
                James and John were with their father. And immediately they left all of that in pursuit of Jesus.
                <br><br>
                I was struck by a very interesting thought that can be very convicting for some:
                What were the disciples thoughts that morning? I mean, God incarnate called them to
                follow Him. This is such a life-changing experience. And I guarantee they treated it
                like any other morning. James got up (probably pretty early since that's when the best
                fishing is), had his "cup of coffee" so to speak, and it was just another day in the life.
                Peter may have very well been caught up with financial trouble and stress over his lack
                of catches the past month. It's ridiculous to realize that their normal lives were changed
                in an instant.
                <br><br>
                That being said, there is no record of argument from them. The Word says they immediately got
                up and followed him. I want a mindset like that. Sometimes my scope of life is so incredibly small.
                I pay attention to the details that most of the time cause me unnecessary anxiety and stress.
                These guys weren't worried about their worries under a microscope. They sensed a bigger picture
                playing out, and they were able to leave their lives to pursue it.
                <br><br>
                There were three guys that were guilty of thinking too small, which removed them from the greatest
                opportunities of their lives.
                <br>"As they were going along the road, someone said to him, 'I will follow you wherever you go.'
                And Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have holes, an dbirds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man
                has nowhere to lay his head.' To another he said, 'Follow me.' But he said, 'Lord, let me first
                go and bury my father.' And Jesus said to him, 'Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you,
                go and proclaim the kingdom of God.' Yet another said, 'I will follow you, Lord, but let me first
                say farewell to those at my home.' Jesus said to him, 'No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks
                back is fit for the kingdom of God.'<br>- Luke 9:57-62
                <br><br>
                It never says whether or not these men followed Jesus or not, but the message is clear.
                The kingdom of God waits for no excuses. There is a war to be fought, a battle to be won.
                And we are called to participate.
                <br><br>
                I want to follow Jesus with a reckless abandon. Abandon in the sense of leaving behind
                the troubles of this world, and being more concerned with the salvation of souls.
                Every excuse can be made as to why I should stay in my comfortable bubble while I let
                others (or God) do the heavy lifting. I want to be prepared to make a move as soon as
                God calls me to something. No excuses, no exceptions, reckless abandon.</p>

          <h3>Holy Hermits</h3>
          <li>
            1/28/15
            <div class ="li-class">
              <p>Sometimes I feel like I would be better off just going to church, reading my
              Bible all day, and praying. But Jesus doesn't want us to be holy hermits.
              <br><br>
              He cast out thousands of demons from a man, who then proceeded to beg Jesus that he
              could follow Him. What great intentions! But there is an urgency in life this side of
              eternity. Jesus wanted to use the man in greater ways than merely pursuing Him.
              <br><br>"And he did not permit him but said to him, 'Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done
              for you, and how he has had mercy on you.' And he went away and began to proclaim in the
              Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled."<br>- Mark 5:19-20
              <br><br>
              Keeping Jesus to ourselves is selfish.

          <h3>Message of Reconciliation</h3>
          <li>
            1/24/15
            <div class ="li-class">
              <p>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has
                come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the
                ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself,
                not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
                Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you
                on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin,
                so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."<br>- 2 Corinthians 5:17-21
                <br><br>
                How cool is it that I get ot live in a time such as today? I know what God asks of me: be
                salt and light and participate in the ministry of reconciliation. It would be hard to be one of the men
                God commanded to slaughter women and children. But my duty today is a joy. Tell people about
                what Christ has done. Show them the fix to their brokenness.
                <br><br>God has entrusted us with this
                message. Has his trust been in vain? How have I treated the gosple? Other people?
                How selfish I am.
                </p>
                <p class = "prayer">
                  Father forgive me.

          <h3>Blue Car or Red Car?</h3>
          <li>
            1/18/15
            <div class="li-class">
              <p>
                Does God know about every movement of an atom? Where it will travel?
                Whether it will bond with this or that atom? How many valence electrons it gains or loses
                in a particular time period?
                <br>Yes. The real question is: does He care?
                <br><br>I have heard it said that, "God cares about 'important things' like a person's salvation
                or sin, but He doesn't care about the little things. I can walk down to the car dealership and
                pick up a Honda in whatever shade I desire. God doesn't care about the color."
                <br><br>I agreed that there are much more important things at hand than something as meaningless
                as a blue or black truck, but then I started to think about myself and when I find my interest
                glossing over a particular subject. See, when I don't care about something, sometimes it stems
                out of a place of uninterest, but often the reality is that I lack either love or time.
                <br><br>I either have more important things to turn my concern toward, or I am lacking compassion.
                I am far too busy to concern myself with a colony of ants constructing their new fortress on
                my front lawn. What about the countless homeless people I pass on my way to work? The innumerable
                orphans, domestic and overseas, that could use significant aid. Why is it that I am more concerned
                with my to-do list than with ants or orphans? Self-absorption creeping into my heart.
                <br><br>To be fair, I am limited. I could dedicate the rest of my life to ant watching or aiding
                orphans. The fact remains that I will never be able to witness all the ant hills on the planet.
                And I will surely be wanting in resources for a plethora of unaided orphans.
                <br><br>I am constricted. God is not.
                <br><br>God lacks neither time nor love. Therefore, I think His concern is aimed not only at the
                "important things", but also at the mundane, average, monotonous. He has planned every little detail
                that spun this hunk of space rock into motion, and keeps it spinning.
                <br><br>"And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together."<br>- Colossions 1:7<br><br>
                Not only is He Creator, but He is also Sustainer. He is never surprised or regretful. He knits reality
                together in a beautiful fashion; all pain and suffering used to draw hearts to Him.
                <br><br>So yes, I think God does care about what color car I drive. There are too many varying
                factors for it to be otherwise. God's plan concerns all of Creation. I believe He is concerned about the
                movement of every minute particle.
                <br><br>That being said, I don't believe that we should follow suit. We are not omniscient nor omnipresent
                beings. We are eternal, but only linearly, and with a finite starting point. We should not lose sleep
                over car colors. We need to "Set [our] minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth."
                (Colossians 3:2). We need to live with a sense of urgency. Who knows how long we will have? How am I
                going to spend my time, knowing it is in limited amount?
                <br><br>"Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.
                What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes."
                <br>- James 4:14<br><br>
                Be encouraged today that God is concerned with the little things so we don't have to be.

            <div class ="li-class">
              <p>What am I doing every day? What is my aim? My goal? What would satisfy me to accomplish?
